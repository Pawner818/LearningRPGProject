# LearningRPGProject UE4 (version 4.25.3)
This project will focus on 3D-Person Character setup and RPG gameplay features:

1) Advanced animation/movement;
2) Interacions with objects: items that can be picked up or cause damage - weapons, coins, health poition, bombs ... 
3) AI enemies: customizable spawn-volume, taking damage from the enemy, advanced Enemy-Navigation system.
4) Regular UMG in RPG style - bars, inventory. 

This file will be updated according to the current progress.

Weekly update (12.16.2020): I improved my Enemy by adding the weapons in his hand, also I added a lot of sounds (like sword swings, Foot Step System etc) and particles to make battles more fun! I like to work with notifies nodes and I like how easily I can get an access to them (using AnimBueprint) and combine them with C++ functions. The next week I'll focus on finishing building the Enemy Combat System - I'll add a damage parameter, Enemy Health Bar and more!
