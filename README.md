UPD (11.15.2020): I decided to rebuild all Enemy system, indcluding locomotion and AI-logic. I also choose a new way to build this system - now it's all about BehaviorTree. I think that for my purposes it's just the best solution and I don't want to invent a wheel again. BehaviorTree is easy to implement, controll, update and to test - that's what I'm looking for when I build a PROTOTYPE of game mechanics. Also it's something that I've never used before and I'm really with how actually my BehaviorTree is working for now. More AI-updates are coming soon!
