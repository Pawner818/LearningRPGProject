# LearningRPGProject UE4 (version 4.25.3)
This project will focus on 3D-Person Character setup and RPG gameplay features:

1) Advanced animation/movement;
2) Interacions with objects: items that can be picked up or cause damage - weapons, coins, health poition, bombs ... 
3) AI enemies: customizable spawn-volume, taking damage from the enemy, advanced Enemy-Navigation system.
4) Regular UMG in RPG style - bars, inventory. 

This file will be updated according to the current progress.

UPD (11.28.2020): AI BT is working, some bugs are still there but the main functions work just fine - Enemy is able to Patrol/Chase/Search.
The next stage is to animate my Mesh in a proper way to be able to pick up a Weapon Class (the Paragon Mesh has a weapon by default). After that I'll figure out how to implement damage system.
