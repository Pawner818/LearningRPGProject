UPD (26.10.2020):
This project is developing very slowly due to lack of time and little experience, but I try to devote enough time to it to improve my skills in UE4. For now I did some refactoring work, still working on transitions between states in C++ style. The main problem is that I have no experience in coding custom AI controller, and when I'm trying to customize my own (not the standart AIControlller), some functions dont work properly. Of course we have dozens ways to programme AI behaviour (like BB,Trees,Custom NavPathFinding ... ), and I still dont know which one is better for my purposes.
